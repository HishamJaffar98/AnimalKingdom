  - "A dog\u2019s level of attention can be determined by watching her ears. Erect
    ears facing forward indicate that she\u2019s engaged, and slightly pulled-back
    ears signal that she\u2019s feeling friendly; ears laid tightly back against
    the head suggest a fearful or timid reaction. Dogs\u2019 ears move independently
    of one another. Even during the quiet hours of the night, the world is a noisy
    place for dogs, who can hear the high-frequency pulse of the crystal resonator
    used in digital alarm clocks and bodily vibrations of termites in the walls.
    It's difficult to examine the ears of a dog and this predisposes dogs to a variety
    of ear ailments, including parasites and yeast infections."
  - Dogs are capable of recognizing melanomas as well as bladder, lung, breast and
    ovarian cancers by sniffing them out. Dog noses can be used for tracking or air
    scenting. In tracking, dogs tend to carry their heads low so as to detect the
    scent of broken vegetation, while in air scenting, dogs will instead carry their
    heads high considering that they are after the lighter, more volatile compounds
    left behind by humans. Wet noses play a primary role in detecting smell. Having
    a wet nose helps dogs capture tiny scent particles which increases a dog's ability
    to detect the smells. Nose touches in dogs may help in transmitting information
    from one dog to another.
  - "The tail is an extension of the spine, but it\u2019s far more flexible. It\u2019s
    also more exposed and active, so there\u2019s a greater chance of injury. A dog\u2019s
    tail has its own set of muscles, anchors, and discs. Some dogs are able to use
    their tails as a rudder in the water, and Retriever breeds are especially good
    at this. The left brain controls the right side of the body, and the right brain
    controls the left side of the body. So positive feelings pull a dog\u2019s tail
    to the right and negative feelings pull it to the left. Tail shaking is an acquired
    skill puppies learn when they are old enough to start communicating. "
  - Deer antlers can grow up to an inch a day, making their tissue among the fastest
    growing on the planet. Antlers start growing in springtime and continue gaining
    size through late summer. By fall, antlers are full grown and begin to harden.
    Many people assume deer antlers are of a keratin material similar to animal horns,
    but deer antlers consist of bone that grows in an open honeycomb style. Most
    biologists believe that antler growth does more than protect deer from predators.
    Deer also use their antlers to compete with other males for mating rights with
    females and also to show dominance in areas where food sources are available.
  - "The trunk of the deer is attached to the legs, neck and tail. The trunk is the
    part of the body that holds the deer\u2019s spinal cord, heart, stomach, kidney,
    liver, lungs and intestines, among other vital organs. Depending upon the species,
    the color of the trunk can be one color or have spots throughout the hair. The
    tail is attached to the back of the trunk, covering the deer\u2019s anus. When
    frightened, white-tailed deer hold their tails straight up, revealing the white
    pattern they possess underneath, which is a sign to other deer that danger is
    present. Food goes into the animal's first stomach chamber called the rumen."
  - A deer foot consists of two elongated toes. They walk, run, and jump on their
    third and fourth phalanges. Each toe is capped by a hard, horny toenail that
    we call the hoof. It's made of keratin, that same material that forms our fingernails.
    A clean, healthy hoof is an elegant structure. The black outer nail is hard and
    strong. It absorbs the shock of every stride and provides traction on soft and
    wet surfaces. It's also a formidable weapon. The inner portion of the hoof is
    softer, but still quite tough. It provides a cushion and traction on harder surfaces.
    In deep mud or snow, dew claws broaden the foot's platform and show up in a deer
    track.
  - Mature male orangutans have large flappy cheek-pads, known as flanges. As soon
    as males begin to develop bigger cheek pads, their testosterone levels peak.
    These large cheek pads or flanges demarcate a distinct difference between fully
    mature males and females. Male orangutans have two developmental stages (1) sub
    adult males and (2) fully adult males. Sub adult males are usually thinner, lack
    the long hair that mature males possess, do not have cheek pads or flanges (they
    are unflanged), and they do not have overly large throat sacs.  These secondary
    sexual characteristics are attractive to adult females and aid males in obtaining
    mates.
  - "Their arms are longer than their bowed legs, and their hands are much like human
    hands. Their arms are used to employ a \"hookgrip\". Since orangutans primarily
    move through the forest using their arms and shoulders as opposed to their legs
    and hips, their shoulders are wider than their hips. When on the ground, they
    walk on all fours, using their palms or their fists. Because orangutans spend
    most of their time in trees, their long arms, fingers and toes are quite useful
    as they swing from branch to branch. An orangutan\u2019s arm-span is longer than
    its height. A male\u2019s arm-span can reach 7 feet (2 meters) from fingertip
    to fingertip."
  - Orangutan toes are long and curved to help hold and quickly release branches
    as they traverse the treetops. The big toe of orangutans oppose the other digits,
    enabling them to grasp and manipulate objects. The opposable big toes are small
    in size so they do not hinder swinging through the forest. Orangutan feet are
    adapted for climbing trees. Their feet grasp branches and serve as an extra support,
    in addition to their hands, when hanging upside-down. Orangutans can hold, eat,
    and manipulate food using their hands or just their feet. This agility allows
    them to even place a foot in their mouth while hanging from a branch.
